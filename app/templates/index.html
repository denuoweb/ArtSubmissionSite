<h1>Quest by Cycle's Badge Contest</h1>

<p>
    Quest by Cycle is an innovative game that encourages cycling, sustainability, and community engagement. Players earn points by completing various quests, and digital badges are awarded as a form of recognition and achievement.
</p>

<p>
    We are calling for artists to help us design these unique badges, bringing their creativity and vision to life. The badges will not only represent different quests but also inspire players to continue their journey toward sustainability.
